                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">About that...</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Well, there's something I have to tell you. Kimura, can you come here please?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">I am honored to meet you, sir. I'm Kimura Taeko. I just graduated from university and joined this publishing company last week.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">What? This must be a joke, right? Are you telling me that...</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Yes, she will be your new editor.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Sir, I may be young with no experience, but I promise you that I will do my very best.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Do you always speak so loudly?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">I'm sorry, sir.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">If there are any problems, I promise to help out.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Nakagawa-san!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Well then, Kimura-san, have you read the first draft?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Of course, sir!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Okay. What did you think?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">It was really good. I loved it. Only you could write that. How are they going to find the killer? I can't wait to read the next story.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">But there is just one thing.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Kimura! What are you talking about? Keep quiet!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">It's all right. What is it?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">The detective wears sunglasses.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Yes? Why is that a problem?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Why did you make him wear sunglasses?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Huh?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Do the sunglasses play an important role in the future? Are they connected with the murder?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Uh, what do you mean?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">For example, are they a special type of sunglasses? Maybe they help you see in the dark and he's the killer?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Uh, no, no. He is not the killer. The real killer is someone different.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Oh. Then why is he wearing them?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Do I need a reason? Sunglasses are cool.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">So, the detective is going to be someone who cares about fashion. Is that right?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Uh, no. I was thinking he is someone who doesn't care about clothes or fashion. He only cares about work.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm. It doesn't make sense. People who don't care about fashion probably don't wear sunglasses.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Oh, well, he doesn't like sunlight.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Your story takes place inside a room with no windows.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Uh...</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Sir, is it possible that you just didn't want to draw the eyes of the detective?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Kimura! You should be careful with your words!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">You are exactly right. I'll take the sunglasses off.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">What? Kimura was right?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Kimura-san, you have a good eye and you weren't scared to tell me your opinion. I like you. We are going to make a good team.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">Thank you, sir.</span></p>
                        <p class="narration"><span class="english-text">Kimura-san, yarimasu ne!

                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa (Editor, more polished):</span> <span class="english-text">I'm absolutely delighted! You're finally going to be crafting some new storylines for your renowned manga series, "Detective's Delights," aren't you?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist (slightly more refined):</span> <span class="english-text">Hmph. Well, I'm pleased you'll be my editor once more, Nakagawa-san. I have a great deal of faith in you, and I very much anticipate our continued collaboration.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Regarding that, actually...</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Well, there's a matter I need to discuss with you. Kimura, would you step in please?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slightly more British English, professional but still energetic):</span> <span class="english-text">It's a genuine honour to meet you, Sir. I'm Taeko Kimura. I've only just graduated from university and joined this publishing house last week.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">What? This is surely a joke, isn't it? Are you suggesting that...</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Indeed, she will be taking over as your new editor.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">You've previously worked with me and possess ample experience. I truly don't wish to seem impolite, but do you genuinely believe she's prepared for a major undertaking such as this?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Sir, whilst I may be new to this field with limited experience, I assure you I shall put forth my absolute best effort.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Do you invariably speak quite so loudly?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura:</span> <span class="english-text">My apologies, Sir.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Should any issues arise, I pledge my full support.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Nakagawa-san!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Very well then, Kimura-san, have you had a chance to review the initial draft?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Absolutely, Sir!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Right. What were your thoughts?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">It was truly brilliant. I adored it. Only you could possibly conjure such a narrative. How on earth will they unmask the culprit? I am absolutely itching to read the next instalment!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Indeed.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">However, there is just one tiny point.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Nakagawa:</span> <span class="english-text">Kimura! What on earth are you going on about? Hold your tongue!</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">It's quite alright. What is it?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">The detective is sporting sunglasses.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Indeed? Why would that pose a difficulty?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Why ever did you opt for him to wear sunglasses?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Do the spectacles play a pivotal role further on? Are they somehow linked to the murder?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Erm, what exactly are you implying?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">For instance, might they be a particular type of eyewear? Perhaps they aid him in perceiving in the dark, and he is the perpetrator?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">No, no, absolutely not. He is certainly not the culprit. The true perpetrator is someone quite different.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">I see. Then what is the rationale behind him wearing them?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Is a reason truly required? Sunglasses are rather stylish.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">So, the detective is to be portrayed as someone with a keen interest in fashion, then? Is that an accurate assessment?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Ah, no. My conception was of someone who pays no mind to attire or style. His sole focus is his work.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Hmm. That does seem rather incongruous. Individuals unconcerned with fashion would scarcely wear sunglasses, one would imagine.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Manga Artist:</span> <span class="english-text">Ah, well then, he simply dislikes direct sunlight.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="speaker-name">Kimura (slight British nuance):</span> <span class="english-text">Your narrative, Sir, is set within an enclosed chamber, devoid of any windows.</span></p>
